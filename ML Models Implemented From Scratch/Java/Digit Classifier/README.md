# This project was entirely implemented from scratch.

With exception of `java.util`, `java.io`, and `jackson` (for processing JSONs for model serialization), all the math and machine learning was implemented from scratch (Matrix class, all matrix operations, the neural network layers, activation function, backpropagation, neural network architecture, etc.)

## Digit Classifier

- A neural network model that takes a 28 x 28 gray scale image of a hand drawn digit from 0 to 9 and classifies it as a digit from 0 to 9.
- Supports model weight serialization, and includes a directory of files formatted `model_X_epochs.json`, each of which corresponds to the weights generated by training the model on the entire dataset for X epochs.
- Includes a UI (using the `javax.swing` UI library) that allows the user to load one of the serialized models, draw a digit on the screen using their mouse, and having the model classify it as a digit from 0 to 9 (and displays the predicted probability for each digit).
